# 🌦️ Weather App - Your Location, Your Weather

Hey there!  
This is a fun little project I made that shows you the live weather at your current location. It uses your device's GPS to grab your location and then fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 💡 What It Does

- Gets your **current location** (yes, you’ll have to allow location access)
- Shows you:
  - 🌡 Temperature in °C
  - 🌤 Weather condition (like Clear, Rainy, Cloudy, etc.)
  - 💧 Humidity
  - 😎 A cool emoji depending on how hot or cold it is
- All wrapped in a clean and smooth UI with a nice gradient background

## 🛠 Tech Behind the Scenes

- **HTML + CSS** for the structure and styling
- **JavaScript** to handle logic and API stuff
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for live weather data
- **Geolocation API** to get your location from your browser
